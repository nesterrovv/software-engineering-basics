# Lab work #1. SRS documentation. Functional & non-functional requirements. RUP template. UML language.
## Variant: 1413

**Task:**

Make a list of requirements for the developed website (according to the option). Requirements should fall into the following categories:

Functional requirements (site user requirements & requirements of site owners) and non-functional requirements;

Requirements must be formatted in accordance with RUP templates (SRS - Software Requirements Specification document). 
For each of the requirements, you need to specify its attributes (in accordance with the RUP methodology), 
as well as estimate and argue the approximate number of hours required to implement this requirement.
For functional requirements, you need to create UML UseCase diagrams that describe the use cases that implement them.

**The lab report should contain:**

1. A Software Requirements Specification document containing a list of site requirements.
2. UseCase diagrams of use cases that implement functional requirements.
3. Work conclusions.

**Questions for the defense of laboratory work:**

1. Software development methodologies. unified process.
2. Requirements and their categorization. Requirements attributes.
3. UML language.
4. Use cases. UseCase-diagrams - composition, types of connections.
